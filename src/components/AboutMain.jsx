        <p className="mt-5">What do you think of when you hear the words full-stack developer? Do you think of a nerd with his  
            glasses staring at a screen for hours on end? Well you might be right! Haha.
            However, this is what I am.... 
            <br/><br/>
            I can conjur a website from nothingness into existence, from darkness I call forth light. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic (maybe a bit of magic). I manipulate the very fabric of the web and its resources (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). 
            <br/><br/>
            By bending the web frameworks (React Js, Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, Django) to my will I can bring your projects and dreams to reality with the push of a button(s). 
            <br/><br/>
            My medical background provides me with a fresh perspective on precision and devotion. In 2019 I graduated from the College of Medicine of the University of Lagos with an MB;BS degree. Being a medical doctor also provides me with the ability to empathize with the users needs and translate these into accessible and functional interfaces as user satisfaction are paramount in my philosophy.
            <br/><br/>
            I can plan, design, build, launch, and maintain a website myself. I have done a couple as you can see below 
            <br/><br/>
            A full-stack developer knows no bounds. And when they find one they cross it without hesitation. It is my hobby to reach into the abyss of the unknown and create perfection.    </p>
